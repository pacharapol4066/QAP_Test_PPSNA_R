REF: https://ph02.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/asit-journal/article/view/244679

This research explored the market positions of seven pasteurized cow’s milk brands in Thailand. Data were collected from a famous social network forum in Thailand, Pantip.com. Comments from the forum were tokenized. The results of tokenization revealed 500 keywords. These keywords were categorized into eight influential factors affecint milk consumption. Brand perceptual maps by the influential factors were constructed using Multidimensional Scaling. Sementic Network and Community Detection techniques were performed on the dataset.

This part used for community finding and generate network graph.

Also, I performed QAP Test (Robustness check & Cross Validation) via R script here.
